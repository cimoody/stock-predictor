    "## Deliverables \n",
    "For this assignment, you will be creating a repository on GitHub for the model and dependencies, and then deploy the model to AWS EC2. Therefore, the specific deliverables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Link to your public repository on GitHub \n",
    "    - scripts `model.py` and `main.py`\n",
    "    - `requirements.txt` (follow instructions for its creation)\n",
    "    - `README.md` that includes how to cURL your API endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Develop a RESTful API with FastAPI\n",
    "- Build a basic time series model to predict stock prices\n",
    "- Deploy a FastAPI to AWS EC2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task 1. Project Setup\n",
    "1. Create a new repository `stock-predictor` on GitHub; make sure to include:\n",
    "    - `README.md`, with a title and short description of the project\n",
    "    - .gitignore using `Python` template\n",
    "    - MIT license\n",
    "1. Create a new virtual environment for this project:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `conda create -n stock-predictor python=3.8`\n",
    "1. Install the following dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `pip install -U -q fastapi uvicorn` \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repo to your local machine \n",
    "1. Activate the virtual environment to start the development process\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `conda activate stock-predictor`\n",
    "4. Create a file `main.py` for our app. Inside the file, create a new instance of `FastAPI` and set up a quick test route\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "    app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "    @app.get(\"/ping\")\n",
    "    def pong():\n",
    "        return {\"ping\": \"pong!\"}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Launch the app in the shell and test the route using the command:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `uvicorn main:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`\n",
    "\n",
    "    Below is the explanation of the command:\n",
    "    - `--reload` enables auto-reload so the server will restart after changes are made to the code base.\n",
    "    - `--workers 1` provides a single worker process.\n",
    "    - `--host 0.0.0.0` defines the address to host the server on.\n",
    "    - `--port 8000` defines the port to host the server on.\n",
    "    - `main:app` tells `uvicorn` where it can find the `FastAPI` ASGI application. In this case, within the `main.py` file, you will find the ASGI app `app = FastAPI()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ping in your browser. You should see:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"ping\": \"pong!\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to predict stock market prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the dependencies:\n",
    "    - Basic data manipulation and plotting: `pandas matplotlib`\n",
    "    - Data and modeling: `yfinance pystan prophet joblib`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new file `model.py` and add the following code to train the model and generate a prediction:\n",
